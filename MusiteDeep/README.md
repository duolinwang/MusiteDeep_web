# PTM prediction

We provide 13 different models for PTM site predictions and customized model training that enables users to train models by their own data. 
Users can find the models in the folder of MusiteDeep/models. 
##### Installation

  - Installation has been tested in Ubuntu 16.04.5 LST and Mac OS HighSierra with python 3.5.2: 
You can install the dependent packages by the following commands:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install -y python3.5 python3-pip
    python3 -m pip install numpy 
    python3 -m pip install scipy
    python3 -m pip install scikit-learn
    python3 -m pip install pillow
    python3 -m pip install h5py
    python3 -m pip install pandas
    python3 -m pip install keras==2.2.4
    python3 -m pip install tensorflow==1.12.0 (or install the GPU supported tensorflow by pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0 refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ for instructions)
    ```
    Download the stand-alone tool by:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/duolinwang/MusiteDeep_web
    ```
##### Running on GPU or CPU
>If you want to use GPU, you also need to install [CUDA]( https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn); refer to their websites for instructions. 
CPU is only suitable for prediction not training. 

##### For general users who want to perform PTM site prediction by our provided model :
go to the MusiteDeep folder which contains the predict_multi_batch.py
```sh
python3 predict_multi_batch.py -input [custom prediction data in FASTA format] -output [custom specified prefix for the prediction results] -model-prefix [prefix of pre-trained model] 
```
For details of the parameters, use the -h or --help parameter.

The -model-prefix can be "models/XX/", here XX representes one pre-trained model in the folder of "MusiteDeep/models/". To predict for multiple PTMs, use ";" to seperate the prefixes of different pre-trained models.
For example to predict for phosphotyrosine and methyllysine simultaneously, run the following command:
```sh
python3 predict_multi_batch.py -input testdata/Phosphorylation/Y/test_allspecies_sequences.fasta -output test/output  -model-prefix "models/Phosphotyrosine;models/Methyllysine";

or

python3 predict_multi_batch.py -input testdata/Phosphorylation/Y/test_allspecies_sequences.fasta -output test/output  -model-prefix "models/Phosphotyrosine;Methyllysine";
```

##### For advanced users who want to perform training and prediction by their own data
Because we used ensemble models by two deep-learning architectures in this server, two types of models need to be trained, one is the CNN model [1] trained by train_CNN_10fold_ensemble.py, the other is the capsule model [2] trained by train_capsnet_10fold_ensemble.py. To train a customized predictor, users can run the following commands and replace with their own data and parameters.
```sh
python3 train_CNN_10fold_ensemble.py -load_average_weight -balance_val -input [custom training data in FASTA format] -output [folder for the output models] -checkpointweights [folder for the intermediate checkpoint files] -residue-types [custom specified residue types]

python3 train_capsnet_10fold_ensemble.py -load_average_weight -balance_val -input [custom training data in FASTA format] -output [folder for the output model] -checkpointweights [folder for the intermediate checkpoint files] -residue-types [custom specified residue types]
```
The training data should be in the FASTA format. Residues followed by "#" indicates the positive sites, residues in the custom specified residue types but without "#" are considered as the negative sites. -residue-types parameter indicate the potential modification residue types that this model focus on. Multiple types of residues are seperated with ','. And all the residues specified by this parameter will be trained in one predictor. For details of other parameters, use the -h or --help parameter.
##### Examples of commands used to train our provided models:
 For Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine:

 ```sh
 python3 train_CNN_10fold_ensemble.py -load_average_weight -balance_val -input "testdata/Phosphorylation/ST/train_allspecies_sequences_annotated.fasta" -output "./models_test/Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine/CNNmodels/" -checkpointweights "./models_test/Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine/CNNmodels/" -residue-types S,T -nclass=1 -maxneg 30
 python3 train_capsnet_10fold_ensemble.py -load_average_weight -balance_val -input "testdata/Phosphorylation/ST/train_allspecies_sequences_annotated.fasta" -output "./models_test/Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine/capsmodels/" -checkpointweights "./models_test/Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine/capsmodels/" -residue-types S,T -nclass=1 -maxneg 30
```
 For Phosphotyrosine, we transfered the pre-trained weights from Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine:
```sh
 python3 train_CNN_10fold_ensemble.py -load_average_weight -balance_val -inputweights ./models/Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine/CNNmodels/model_HDF5model_fold0_class0 -input "testdata/Phosphorylation/Y/train_allspecies_sequences_annotated.fasta" -output "./models_test/Phosphotyrosine/CNNmodels/" -checkpointweights "./models_test/Phosphotyrosine/CNNmodels/" -residue-types Y -nclass=1 -maxneg 30
 python3 train_capsnet_10fold_ensemble.py -load_average_weight -balance_val -inputweights ./models/Phosphoserine_Phosphothreonine/capsmodels/model_HDF5model_fold0_class0 -input "testdata/Phosphorylation/Y/train_allspecies_sequences_annotated.fasta" -output "./models_test/Phosphotyrosine/capsmodels/" -checkpointweights "./models_test/Phosphotyrosine/capsmodels/" -residue-types Y -nclass=1 -maxneg 30
 ```
